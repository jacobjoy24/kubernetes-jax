Goal: Access Pod from another Pod

- Determine IP of the target Pod
- Start an interactive Pod and use curl to access the target pod
- Note: When starting a Pod with --rm and -it it is deleted after exiting the shell

$ kubectl get pods -o wide
$ kubectl run shell --rm -it --image=trion/curl 
$ curl http://<pod-ip>:3000

It is not possible to use the name of the Pod instead of the IP.


Clean up all running Pods after this lab

$ kubectl delete pods --all

and start a fresh instance of the 'demo' pod

$ kubectl run --image ghcr.io/trion-development/echoserver:2 demo
